## Vector

just me playing around with c++, oops and testing my knowledge

Start Date : 07.07.24

Time : 10:36 PM

## Why?

i'dont know! i did a course on object-oriented programming in c++ course last sem. its been two months since then i haven't written much code in c++. i think its a good time to brush up my knowledge of oops, templates, friend functions and operator overloading.

## Learning Objectives

1. the big-5
2. operator overloading
3. templates
4. makefiles
5. neovim (becuase i am getting into it! really! i don't know why??)

## Requirements

create a library to perform operations on Vectors (2D/3D). yup. that's it. nothing new!

- [x] create 2D/3D templae Vectors class of type int, bytes, float, double
- [x] default,parametarized and copy constructors
- [x] pre and post increment operator overloading
- [x] compound assignment operators(-=, +=) operator overloadin
- [x] addition operator overloading : add two or more Vectors
- [x] subratction operator overloading: subtract two or more Vectors
- [x] distance between two Vectors - friend functions
- [x] compound assignment operator(\*=) overloading
- [x] multiplication operator overloading
- [x] magnitude of a vector
- [x] dot product
- [x] cross product
- [x] cout and cin operator overloading
- [x] update readme with usage examples (add references wherever needed)
- [ ] create a src/examples directory for examlples showcasing usage of the library
- [ ] add tests for all methods
