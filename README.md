just me playing around with c++, oops and testing my knowledge

Start Date : 07.07.24
Time : 10:36 PM

## Why?
i'dont know! i did a course on object-oriented programming in c++ course last sem. its been two months since then i haven't written much code in c++. i think its a good time to brush up my knowledge of oops, templates, friend functions and operator overloading.

## Learning Objectives
1. the big-5
2. operator overloading
3. templates
4. makefiles
5. neovim (becuase i am getting into it! really! i don't know why??)

## Requirements
create a library to perform operations on points (2D/3D). yup. that's it. nothing new!
- [] create 2D/3D points of type int, bytes, float, double
- [] pre and post increment operator overloading
- [] add two or more points
- [] subtract two or more points
- [] distance between two points
